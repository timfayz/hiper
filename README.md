# Hiper Programming Language

**Hiper** is a simple tree-based programming language that consolidates common patterns across programming languages into a single, coherent notation, allowing for effective transpilation of code to other high-level languages. This simplifies the creation and maintenance of a unified codebase that can be reused across different environments, languages, and paradigms while preserving the original logic. This allows developers to generate reusable code across multiple environments, reducing cognitive load, interoperability issues, language "lock-ins," and improving code verifiability.

Hiper offers a simple yet expressive programming model based on a simplified *neuron* (node) structure. It allows for working with complex and seemingly unrelated data within one model and codebase, whether for cascading page layouts, functional programming, or designing relational databases. This approach simplifies the development workflow, enables seamless transfer across platforms without dependency issues, eliminates the need to install specific programming languages by transpiling logic to an available one, and provides other benefits. 

The project is being developed using [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) programming language to ensure it is fast and embeddable, allowing it to be imported as a C-ABI compatible library and used as a scripting language.

**Please note**: I made this project early public as I am applying for a grant, and I hope it would facilitate an easier code review. Happy exploring! ðŸ”­
