# Hiper Programming Language

**Hiper** is a simple tree-based programming language that focuses on making code _timeless_. It simplifies multi-language and multi-platform software development by consolidating common patterns from various programming languages into a single notation, enabling flexible constructs and effective transpilation into other high-level languages. This allows developers to generate reusable code across multiple environments, reducing cognitive load, interoperability issues, language "lock-ins," and improving code verifiability.

The project is being developed using the [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) programming language to ensure it is fast and embeddable, allowing it to be imported as a C-ABI compatible library and used as a scripting language.

**Please note**: I made this project early public as I am applying for a grant, and I hope it would facilitate an easier code review process. Happy exploring! ðŸ”­
